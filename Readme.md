This project is sample code from GODZ Engine. Note a lot of this code dates all the way back to 2010 and earlier. 

There's tons of things I'd do differently.
* Use Git for Source Control rather than Perforce
* Probably wouldn't use MACROS to bake the dynamic type information. Instead I'd go with a stronger Composition
* Cleaner code in some places.
